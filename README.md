# Carrefour-Kenya-Data-Analysis-using-Unsupervised-Learning-in-R
# Description
Working as a data scientist at Carrefour Kenya, the main aim is to undertake a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax) by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.
The four unsupervised learning techniques applied are Dimensionality reduction, Feature Selection, Association rules and Anomaly Detection.

### PART 1-Dimensionality Reduction
This part focuses on reducing number of random variables in a dataset that represent the initial variables of the datset.The main technique applied is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the datset used to apply this technique can be accessed via this link: http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset. 


### PART 2-Feature Selection
This part of the project focuses on applying different techniques in a bid to understand the contribution of the variables in the dataset. The techniques applied are Filter methods, wrapper methods and feature ranking. The dataset used to apply feature selection can be found on this link: http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset.


### PART 3-Association Rules
This part of research is aimed at discovering patterns that ocur within the given dataset by identifying relationships between observations and and variables from the dataset.
The dataset for this part can be accessed here: http://bit.ly/SupermarketDatasetII.


### PART 4-Anomaly Detection
This part of research is aimed at unveiling any patterns or discoveries in the dataset that are not as per the norm.Carrefour Kenya would like to detect fraud based on the dataset provided via this link: http://bit.ly/CarreFourSalesDataset thus application of anomaly detection technique.

# SetUp/Installation requirements
All you need to run this code is a browser with access to Google CoLab or Jupyter Notebook. Installation of RStudio is also an alternative way to run this code.Both tools are for data preparation and analysis.


# Technologies Used
This project uses R as the main language and a number of libraries and packages have been incorporated.

# Support and Contact Details
Feel free to make any contributions to the code and in case of any issues or questions, ideas or concerns please reach out to me via this email: audreyimali18@gmail.com
